"""Landing acceptance: layout selection and bounded-search capability.

CORRECTED 2026-09-01 (pre-implementation, empirically verified against the
research tree): the original version of this gate required *production*
selection to pick nonuniform depth>1 layouts on the tiny sealed synthetic
families. Running the sealed research planner showed that is unsatisfiable by
a faithful physical cost model — on token sequences a few dozen tokens long,
sharing never pays under GDN/CP costs, and the research production score
correctly selects no-sharing there (its "nonuniform selection" results came
from the search-quality harness under an injected adversarial scorer). The
corrected gate matches what the research actually sealed:

1. PRODUCTION SELECTION, physical scale: on the sealed GPU win-cell shape
   (GRPO primary_long_g8: 2 groups x 8 completions, system 2048, prompt 8192,
   completion 512) the planner must select depth > 1 and pack dramatically
   fewer physical than logical tokens. Verified against the research planner:
   depth 3, 26,624 physical for 172,032 logical — identical to the sealed
   cold witness of the GPU campaign.
2. PRODUCTION SELECTION, declines-when-unprofitable: on the tiny sealed
   corpus families and on a heterogeneous control, the planner must select
   depth <= 1 / no sharing. (Verified: the research planner does exactly
   this.)
3. SEARCH CAPABILITY: with an injected scorer whose cost surface demands
   nonuniform decisions (the sealed adversarial branch-interaction scorer),
   the bounded search must recover the exhaustive-oracle optimum on the
   sealed corpus trees (all <= 14 decisions, so the oracle is enumerable).
4. Determinism at both scales.

ADAPTATION POINT: the ``_planner`` import shim may be adjusted once at landing
if module or function names differ. The required surface:
``build_canonical_prefix_tree(sequences)``,
``prefix_tree_layout_candidates(tree)`` (candidates carry ``.layout`` and
``.labels``), ``select_prefix_tree_layout(tree, *, cp_size, layers, uses_gdn,
refinement_work_budget)``, ``iter_all_prefix_tree_layouts(tree)``, and
``search_prefix_tree_layout(tree, scorer, *, refinement_work_budget)`` for
scorer injection. Assertion bodies are the acceptance criteria and must not
be weakened.

These tests define the landing contract: written and fail-verified before
the implementation, they must pass unmodified on the landed tree.
