# Megatron Runtime Isolation Tests

Runtime-boundary and vLLM-isolation integration tests live in this directory.

Rules:

- Write runtime-isolation artifacts under `tests/integration/megatron/runtime_isolation/artifacts/`.
- Do not run these tests from a dirty worktree.
- Any code involved in a test run must be committed before the test starts.
- Every artifact set must include the exact commit hash it ran from.

Live smokes:

- `test_live_runtime_server_smoke.py` validates the external runtime directly.
- `test_live_megatron_backend_smoke.py` validates ART-level Megatron shared and dedicated runtime flows.
- `test_live_yes_no_trainability.py` validates workflow-style yes/no trainability on the requested backend/mode matrix.
- `test_live_local_backend_smoke.py` validates the ART `LocalBackend` path.
- Both are opt-in and are expected to write artifacts for every attempted run.

Use the `artifact_dir` fixture from [conftest.py](./conftest.py) for artifact output.

That fixture:

- refuses to run when the worktree is dirty
- creates a per-test artifact directory under `artifacts/`
- writes `run_metadata.json` with the exact commit hash and test node id

Artifact directories are git-ignored by design so reproducible outputs do not dirty the worktree.
