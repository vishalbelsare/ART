"""
RULER (Relative Universal LLM-Elicited Rewards) - A general-purpose reward function for RL agents.

RULER uses an LLM-as-judge to rank multiple agent trajectories relative to each other,
requiring no labeled data or hand-crafted reward functions. It leverages the insight
that relative scoring is easier than absolute scoring, and GRPO only needs relative
scores within each group.

    This is the low-level API that works with raw message lists. For integration
    with ART's training loop, use `ruler_score_group` instead.

    RULER works by:
    1. Extracting common prefixes from trajectories to save tokens
    2. Passing all trajectories to an LLM judge for relative scoring
    3. Returning scores that can be used directly as rewards in GRPO

    The key insight is that relative scores within a group are all that matters
    for GRPO, which normalizes them anyway.

    Args:
        message_lists: A list where each item is a list of ChatCompletionMessageParam
            dicts representing a single trajectory.

            - "openai/gpt-4o-mini" - Fast and cost-effective
            - "openai/o3" - Most capable but expensive (default)
            - "anthropic/claude-3-opus-20240229" - Alternative judge
            - "ollama/qwen3:32b" - Local Ollama judge via LiteLLM
            The default calls OpenAI through LiteLLM. Set this explicitly for
            local or custom judge backends.
        extra_litellm_params: Additional parameters to pass to LiteLLM completion.
            Can include temperature, max_tokens, etc.
        rubric: The grading rubric. The default rubric works well for most tasks.
        tools: Optional list of tool definitions available to the agent. When provided,
            the judge will see which tools were available when evaluating tool usage.
        debug: If True, pretty-print the judge's reasoning to help understand scores.
