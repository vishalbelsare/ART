MCP•RL is a specialized application of ART that teaches language models to effectively use [Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/). This approach enables you to train agents that can seamlessly interact with any MCP-compatible tool or service.

## What is MCP•RL?

MCP•RL combines two powerful technologies:

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: A standard for connecting AI assistants to external tools and data sources
- **ART (Agent Reinforcement Trainer)**: OpenPipe's framework for training better AI agents using reinforcement learning

The result is a training pipeline that can automatically teach any language model to use MCP servers effectively, without requiring manually labeled training data.

## How MCP•RL Works

The training process follows these key steps:

### 1. **Server Discovery**

```python
# Query the MCP server to understand available tools
tools_list = await mcp_client.list_tools()
```

### 2. **Scenario Generation**

```python
# Generate diverse training scenarios automatically
from art.mcp import generate_scenarios

scenario_collection = await generate_scenarios(
    tools=tools_list,
    num_scenarios=24,
    show_preview=True,
    generator_model="openai/gpt-4.1-mini",
    generator_api_key="your_openrouter_key",
    generator_base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
)
```

ART automatically generates diverse training scenarios that exercise different aspects of the MCP server: simple single-tool usage, complex multi-step workflows, edge cases and error handling, and creative combinations of available tools.

### 3. **RULER Evaluation**

```python
from art.rewards import ruler_score_group

# RULER evaluates responses without labeled data
scored_group = await ruler_score_group(
    group,
    judge_model="openai/o4-mini",
)
```

Instead of requiring human-labeled examples, RULER judges response quality by analyzing whether the agent accomplished the intended task, quality of tool usage, efficiency of the approach, and error handling.

### 4. **Reinforcement Learning**

```python
# Train using RULER feedback
groups = await gather_trajectory_groups(
    trajectory_groups_generator,
    pbar_desc="train gather step",
)

scored_groups = [
    await ruler_score_group(
        group,
        judge_model="openai/o4-mini",
    )
    for group in groups
]

await model.train(
    scored_groups,
    config=art.TrainConfig(learning_rate=1e-5),
)
```

The model learns from RULER feedback using reinforcement learning, improving its ability to select appropriate tools, use correct parameters, chain tools effectively, and handle failures gracefully.

## Getting Started

Optimizing against an MCP server can be surprisingly straightforward!

### Prerequisites

- Access to an MCP server you want to train on
- OpenRouter API key for training
- Python environment with ART installed

### Basic Training Pipeline

Here's a simplified example of training a model to use an MCP server:

```python
import art
from art.mcp import generate_scenarios
from art.rewards import ruler_score_group
from art import gather_trajectory_groups

# Initialize the model
model = art.RemoteModel(
    model="Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct",
    openrouter_api_key="your_openrouter_key"
)

# Generate training scenarios automatically
scenario_collection = await generate_scenarios(
    tools=tools_list,
    resources=resources_list,
    num_scenarios=100,
    show_preview=False,
    generator_model="gpt-4o-mini",
    generator_api_key="your_openrouter_key",
)

# Gather trajectory groups
groups = await gather_trajectory_groups(
    (
        art.TrajectoryGroup(
            rollout(model, scenario, False)
            for _ in range(4)  # rollouts per group
        )
        for scenario in scenario_collection
    ),
    pbar_desc="train gather step",
)

# Score groups using RULER
scored_groups = [
    await ruler_score_group(
        group,
        judge_model="gpt-4o-mini",
        debug=True,
        swallow_exceptions=True
    )
    for group in groups
]

# Train the model
await model.train(
    scored_groups,
    config=art.TrainConfig(learning_rate=1e-5),
)
```

### Example Use Cases

- **Database Agent**: Train a model to query databases, understand schemas, and generate appropriate SQL commands via an MCP database server.

- **File Management Agent**: Teach an agent to navigate file systems, read/write files, and perform complex file operations through an MCP file server.

- **API Integration Agent**: Train models to interact with REST APIs, handle authentication, and process responses via MCP API wrappers.

- **Development Tools Agent**: Create agents that can use development tools like Git, package managers, or testing frameworks through MCP servers.

## What MCP•RL is Good At

MCP•RL excels at training agents to effectively use MCP servers by:

- **Tool Usage**: Teaching when and how to use specific tools with appropriate parameters
- **Multi-Step Workflows**: Chaining tool calls and interpreting outputs to build complex workflows
- **Domain Adaptation**: Learning specialized terminology and conventions for different server types

## Best Practices

- 📈 **Iterative Training** - Use checkpoint forking to experiment with different training approaches and parameters.

- 🔍 **Monitor RULER Scores** - Pay attention to RULER evaluation metrics to understand where your agent excels and where it needs improvement.

- 🧪 **Test Thoroughly** - Validate your trained agent on held-out scenarios that weren't used during training.

- 📊 **Use Diverse Scenarios** - Ensure your training data covers the full range of tasks your agent will encounter in production.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Low RULER Scores**:

- Check if your MCP server is responding correctly
- Verify that generated scenarios are appropriate for your use case
- Consider adjusting training parameters

**Tool Selection Errors**:

- Ensure the model has seen diverse examples of when to use each tool
- Add more training scenarios that require careful tool selection

**Parameter Issues**:

- Include scenarios that demonstrate correct parameter usage
- Consider adding validation examples to your training data

<Note>
  MCP•RL is particularly effective because RULER can judge response quality
  purely from the agent's final output—no labeled data required! This makes it
  possible to train high-quality MCP agents with minimal manual intervention.
